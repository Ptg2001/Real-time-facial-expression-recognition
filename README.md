## Introduction

Facial recognition technology has seen incredible advancements in recent years, thanks to the power of deep learning. My project dives deep into this domain, offering a practical implementation of real-time facial recognition using state-of-the-art techniques.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Recognition**: The system doesn't just recognize faces; it does so in real-time, providing instant feedback.
  
- **Machine Learning at its Core**: Leveraging the prowess of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, I've trained the model to be highly accurate and efficient.
  
- **TensorFlow and CNN**: We've utilized TensorFlow, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, to build the models. Additionally, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures form the backbone of the recognition system.
  
- **Confusion Matrix Visualization**: Understanding the performance of the model is crucial. That's why I've plotted confusion matrices to gain insights into how well the system is performing.
  
- **Data Source**: Model has been trained on the FER2013 dataset, a rich resource for facial expression recognition research.
